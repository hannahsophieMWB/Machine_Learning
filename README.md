# Tennis Ace
A Codecademy project from the Data Science course Machine Learning section, supervised machine learning (linear regression model).


## ðŸŽ¯ Objective 

In this project, we will create a linear regression model that predicts the outcome for a tennis player based on their playing habits. By analyzing and modeling the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) data, we will determine what it takes to be one of the best tennis players in the world. ATP is a tennis association for men only and unfortunately, no comoparable data set exists for women's tennis.

No three words are sweeter to hear as a tennis player than those, which indicate that a player has beaten their opponent. While you can head down to your nearest court and aim to overcome your challenger across the net without much practice, a league of professionals spends day and night, month after month practicing to be among the best in the world. 

Using supervised machine learning models, test the data to better understand what it takes to be an all-star tennis player.
